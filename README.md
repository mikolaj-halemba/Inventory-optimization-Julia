<h1 align="center">Simulation Optimization for Inventory Management.</h1>

<h3 align="center">This project revolves around the optimization of the existing inventory system, specifically, its parameters (s, S). The COO and CFO of a retail chain have approached you, their primary Data Scientist, with a task to enhance the existing inventory model.</h3>
<p align="center">Inventory Optimization</p>
<p align="center">There are two main goals that the management wants to achieve with this task:</p>
<p align="center">Minimizing Inventory Levels - The CFO is primarily concerned with lowering the levels of inventory. This will reduce the cost of capital tied up in stored goods, which, with rising interest rates, is a significant financial burden for the company.</p>
<p align="center">Maintaining or Improving Customer Satisfaction - The COO wants to ensure high product availability on store shelves, either by maintaining the current levels of customer satisfaction or by enhancing it. The COO believes this will be possible through better inventory management.</p>
